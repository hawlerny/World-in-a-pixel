bad cod for no purpos, not work most of time !


for now it has only the launcher and the begining of a game.

to do:
- fixing the background animation speed scaling with fps
- making the start game animation by clicking on the pixel aswel as a popup or a nice thing to notify the player he can do that
- making or first material and putting it in the inventory tab
- starting the panels fonctionalities by adding the options on the left one and the first tool on the right one
- well see ...
